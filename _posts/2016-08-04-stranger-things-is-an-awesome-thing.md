![Stranger Things is and Awesome Thing](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/18753564-c254-4787-a9a7-6f133bc91ae2.jpg)

Take Goonies, Stand By Me, X-Files and sprinkle it with a little Guillermo Del Toro and you get Stranger Things.

It felt like it came out of nowhere. Limited promotion. Unknown hype. Just a tile on my Netflix account that said "Stranger Things". The buzz was definitely there online and chatter was starting to happen, so I felt it calling and dove in. After 1 episode I was hooked.

As I took to the twitter-verse I asked a simple question after 2 episodes: Am I getting a "Stand By Me Vibe. Thoughts? The answers poured in with crazy excitement. A lost art. A vibe that only good 80s movies had about friendship, cool kids, bullying, outsiders, aliens, all mashed up into something modern and relevant.

Stanger Things, written by Matt and Ross Duffer stars Wynona Ryder, David Harbour and Matthew Modine. Set in the 80s, this series follows a group of 12 yr old boys as they search for their missing friend who is taken to another universe. 

What I can't do is summarize or even try to explain what this movie embodies other than to say if you loved classic 80s scifi thriller movies then look no further.
